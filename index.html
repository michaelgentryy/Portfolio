                    <p>Hello! My name is Michael Gentry, and I am a passionate Technical Game Designer.
                        <br><br>
                        I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Game Design from Full Sail University, where I was
                        honored with an award for my achievements.
                        <br><br>
                        Since graduation, I’ve become deeply invested in the lifecycle of game development. I have been
                        constantly seeking to expand my expertise beyond programming and into areas like 3D modeling and animation.
                        I am committed to honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, I work exclusively in Unreal Engine, but I intend to branch out and learn other
                        engines as my career progresses.
                        <br><br>
                        If you're a potential employer, I’d love the opportunity to contribute to your team and make a
                        lasting impact. Joining your team would mark a pivotal moment in my career journey, and I am
                        excited to grow alongside you.
                        <br><br>
                        Feel free to download my resume below if you don't already have it. As my career expands, so
                        will my portfolio and resume — perhaps with your help.
                        <br><br>

                <p>Jumping into Deadwood Dominance was my first deep dive into the game development world. I was right there in the trenches, working on the AI - adjusting animations, tinkering with the state machine, implementing mechanics, and synchronizing behaviors of the behavior tree with the animations. It felt like an adventure, every day was a new learning experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The process was filled with countless iterations, a lot of trial and error, and a meticulous attention to detail. But the real thrill was seeing our ideas take shape, creating gameplay that kept players on their toes. Although Deadwood Dominance is still in its alpha stage, the journey has been nothing short of amazing. The sense of accomplishment I feel, knowing that I’ve contributed to the game’s immersive gameplay, is something I hold closely.

            </div>

            <div class="w3-container w3-threequarter mySlides mediaInfo">
                <video autoplay loop muted src="media/dd/AI_Health.mp4" id="videoOneDD"></video>
                <p>In Deadwood Dominance, one of the features I take great pride in is the health indicators for our AI. The solution might seem straightforward now, but initially, we were at a crossroads. Some team members suggested floating health bars above the AI, while others proposed a static health bar for the last hit enemy at the top-center of the screen. Both options, however, fell short. Given the hordes of zombies (AI) in our game, neither approach would allow players to accurately gauge a zombie’s health.
                    <br><br>
                    So, I got creative. I exported the AI materials and re-colored them three times using Photoshop. As a result, the AI’s mesh changes color based on their health percentage, giving players a clear indication of how close each zombie is to defeat.
                    <br><br>
                    What makes me proud isn’t the complexity of the solution, but rather its effectiveness in overcoming a challenge.

            <div class="w3-container w3-threequarter mySlides mediaInfo">
                <video autoplay loop muted src="media/dd/AI_Knockback.mp4" id="videoTwoDD"></video>
                <p>In the development of Deadwood Dominance, one of the most significant mechanics I implemented was the AI knockback ability, also known as impulse. Given the game’s hoard-like zombie setting, it was crucial to equip the player with a defensive mechanism for those moments when they’re swarmed by enemies. It might seem straightforward on the surface, but the inner workings presented quite a challenge.
                    <br><br>
                    Initially, I envisioned a ragdoll-like core for this mechanic. However, it quickly became clear that this approach was causing more problems than it was solving. So, it was back to the drawing board for me.
                    <br><br>
                    The solution I came up with was the impulse mechanic. Here’s how it works: The impulse performs a multi-sphere trace, checking for the AI Base class. For each AI hit, it checks if it’s already in the array. If it isn’t, it gets added; if it is, it’s ignored. Then, each AI has their behavior aborted to initiate the knockback, which triggers the corresponding animation. To prevent the player from getting stuck in the knocked-back AI, the collision is turned off.
                    <br><br>
                    After a duration that’s synced with the animation, the collision is turned back on. The animation then transitions to the standing pose and resumes playing. The behavior tree switches to attack/chase mode, and the array is cleared.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="w3-container w3-threequarter mySlides mediaInfo">
                <video autoplay loop muted src="media/dd/AI_Death_States.mp4" id="videoThreeDD"></video>
                <p>The AI characters have two distinct death states, each triggered based on the AI’s current state.
                    <br><br>
                    The first is what we call the normal death state. This state is triggered when the AI character is not in a knocked-back state. In this scenario, the AI plays a standing death animation and then falls to the ground, simulating a typical death sequence.
                    <br><br>
                    The second state is the ground death state. This state comes into play when the AI character has been knocked back. In this case, the AI plays a ground death animation, depicting a death scenario where the AI character is already on the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    This dual-state death mechanic adds a layer of realism to the game, making the AI characters react differently to death based on their current state. It’s these little details that contribute to the immersive gameplay experience in Deadwood Dominance.

                <p>The primary combat weapons are different staff types the player can acquire. Currently, there are 3 types:
                    <br><br>
                    Lightning Staff <br>
                    Water Staff <br>
                    Fire Staff <br>
                    <br><br>
                    All 3 have a unique basic attack, special attack, and Ground UI. The different types deal mitigated or multiplied damage against different enemy types.

                <p>One of the bigger challenges that I presented to myself was casting cancellation and the UI. Making sure the player should cast when they want to, can cancel when they don't want to, and can't when they aren't supposed to.
                    <br><br>
                    To begin this, I started with being able to cancel the special ability with Left Click. The player can hold Right Click to draw the UI and prepare for casting. You can Left Click to cancel it or release right click to commit and cast it.
                    <br><br>
                    Alternatively, if you try to cast outside the casting range, the UI will vanish, and they player will not be able to cast. Releasing Right Click in this instance will cancel the special ability.
                    <br><br>
                    To prevent casting issues, a dot product is calculated to make sure the ground is level where the player intends to cast to ensure the player cannot cast on the sides of building or other vertical object that they shouldn't be able to cast on.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, the player should not be able to cast indoors. If the player walks into a building, the special cast will cancel. Also, as you can tell in the video, the timers and cooldowns reset on the ability cancellation.

                <p>One of the last things that I was proud of implementing was the interact system. It's swift and accurate, I can trade as fast as I can hit the interact button with little to no issues.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from that, each actor that can be interacted with get highlighted and get an image of the interact key above them. The player can hit the interact key and that will fire off a line trace. If the item hit can be interacted with, it's attached to the socket, and the stats get passed off.

                    <div class="description-item active">
                        <h4>Introduction</h4>

                        <p>AnyPrint began as a Blueprint Function Library, created to provide an easy way to debug in
                            Unreal Engine. Initially, it included simple print functions like PrintBool, PrintVector,
                            and PrintRotator.
                        </p>

                        <p>As I continued to develop the tool, I had the idea to move it to C++ and create a more robust
                            log manager by leveraging the power of Editor Utility Widgets. This transition created for a
                            better debugging experience by allowing more access to the information that needed to be
                            printed.</p>

                        <p>The goal of AnyPrint is to offer a comprehensive logging system that can store any type of
                            output, making it easier to locate specific logs without sifting through the entire output
                            log. Each log entry includes a timestamp and the log output, providing a clear and organized
                            way to track debugging information.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>The Foundation</h4>
                        <p>The core of AnyPrint is the SaveLogToFile function. This function takes an input string, adds
                            a timestamp, and saves it to Saved/Logs/LogFile.txt.</p>

                        <p>Each log entry is stored in a LogEntries array, which is then read by the LogManager. The
                            delegate is called, and the widget updates accordingly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Log Management</h4>
                        <p>The LogManager is responsible for storing all logs in the LogEntries array. It encapsulates
                            all the unique features and ideas for managing logs.</p>

                        <p>Currently, the LogManager allows you to change the text size of the logs and clear the log
                            entries. It can store an average of 5000 logs before impacting the editor's performance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Upcoming Implementations</h4>
                        <p>As the project evolves, I plan to introduce features such as colored text, index support, and
                            various visual enhancements.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, I intend to release AnyPrint on the Unreal Engine Marketplace (FAB) for free,
                            making
                            it accessible to anyone who might find it useful.</p>

                        <p>I hope AnyPrint proves as helpful to others as it has been for me. I'm excited to hear
                            feedback and suggestions for new features from users. Understanding what people find
                            valuable will greatly influence and inspire future projects.</p>

                        <p>WhisperWinds is a personal project of mine. It's really something I'm working on to test and
                            push my own skills further. I've fallen in love with the project and work on it in my free
                            time. Keep in mind that it is still rough around the edges but progress is being made.</p>

                        <p>The primary combat weapons are different staff types the player can acquire. Currently, there
                            are 3 types:</p>
                        <p>Lightning Staff</p>
                        <p>Water Staff</p>
                        <p>Fire Staff</p>
                        <p>All 3 have a unique basic attack, special attack, and Ground UI. The different types deal
                            mitigated or multiplied damage against different enemy types.</p>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Casting & UI</h4>

                        <p>One of the bigger challenges that I presented to myself was casting cancellation and the UI.
                            Making sure the player should cast when they want to, can cancel when they don't want to,
                            and can't when they aren't supposed to.</p>

                        <p>To begin this, I started with being able to cancel the special ability with Left Click. The
                            player can hold Right Click to draw the UI and prepare for casting. You can Left Click to
                            cancel it or release right click to commit and cast it.</p>

                        <p>Alternatively, if you try to cast outside the casting range, the UI will vanish, and they
                            player will not be able to cast. Releasing Right Click in this instance will cancel the
                            special ability.</p>

                        <p>To prevent casting issues, a dot product is calculated to make sure the ground is level where
                            the player intends to cast to ensure the player cannot cast on the sides of building or
                            other vertical object that they shouldn't be able to cast on.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, the player should not be able to cast indoors. If the player walks into a building,
                            the special cast will cancel. Also, as you can tell in the video, the timers and cooldowns
                            reset on the ability cancellation.</p>

                        <h4>Intro</h4>

                        <p>Jumping into Deadwood Dominance was my first deep dive into the game development world. I was
                            right there in the trenches, working on the AI - adjusting animations, tinkering with the
                            state machine, implementing mechanics, and synchronizing behaviors of the behavior tree with
                            the animations. It felt like an adventure, every day was a new learning experience.</p>

                        <p>The process was filled with countless iterations, a lot of trial and error, and a meticulous
                            attention to detail. But the real thrill was seeing our ideas take shape, creating gameplay
                            that kept players on their toes. Although Deadwood Dominance is still in its alpha stage,
                            the journey has been nothing short of amazing. The sense of accomplishment I feel, knowing
                            that I&rsquo;ve contributed to the game&rsquo;s immersive gameplay, is something I hold
                            closely.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Health</h4>
                        <p>In Deadwood Dominance, one of the features I take great pride in is the health indicators for
                            our AI. The solution might seem straightforward now, but initially, we were at a crossroads.
                            Some team members suggested floating health bars above the AI, while others proposed a
                            static health bar for the last hit enemy at the top-center of the screen. Both options,
                            however, fell short. Given the hordes of zombies (AI) in our game, neither approach would
                            allow players to accurately gauge a zombie&rsquo;s health.</p>

                        <p>So, I got creative. I exported the AI materials and re-colored them three times using
                            Photoshop. As a result, the AI&rsquo;s mesh changes color based on their health percentage,
                            giving
                            players a clear indication of how close each zombie is to defeat. What makes me proud
                            isn&rsquo;t
                            the complexity of the solution, but rather its effectiveness in
                            overcoming a challenge.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Knockback</h4>
                        <p>In the development of Deadwood Dominance, one of the most significant mechanics I implemented
                            was the AI knockback ability, also known as impulse. Given the game&rsquo;s hoard-like
                            zombie
                            setting, it was crucial to equip the player with a defensive mechanism for those moments
                            when they&rsquo;re swarmed by enemies. While it might seem straightforward on the surface,
                            the
                            inner workings presented quite a challenge.</p>

                        <p>Initially, I envisioned a ragdoll-like core for this mechanic. However, it quickly became
                            clear that this approach was causing more problems than it was solving. So, it was back to
                            the drawing board for me.</p>

                        <p>The solution I came up with was the impulse mechanic. Heres how it works: The impulse
                            performs a multi-sphere trace, checking for the AI Base class. For each AI hit, it checks if
                            it&rsquo;s already in the array. If it isn&rsquo;t, it gets added; if it is, &rsquo;s
                            ignored. Then, each AI
                            has their behavior aborted to initiate the knockback, which triggers the corresponding
                            animation. To prevent the player from getting stuck in the knocked-back AI, the collision is
                            turned off.</p>

                        <p>After a duration that&rsquo;s synced with the animation, the collision is turned back on. The
                            animation then transitions to the standing pose and resumes playing. The behavior tree
                            switches to attack/chase mode, and the array is cleared.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="description-item">
                        <h4>Death</h4>

                        <p>The AI characters have two distinct death states, each triggered based on the AI&rsquo;s
                            current state.</p>

                        <p>The second state is the ground death state. This state comes into play when the AI character
                            has been knocked back. In this case, the AI plays a ground death animation, depicting a
                            death scenario where the AI character is already on the ground.</p>

                        <p>This dual-state death mechanic adds a layer of realism to the game, making the AI characters
                            react differently to death based on their current state. It’s these little details that
                            contribute to the immersive gameplay experience in Deadwood Dominance.</p>

                Deadwood Dominance
            </div>

            <p>
                Jumping into Deadwood Dominance was my first deep dive into the game development world. I was right there in the trenches, working on the AI - adjusting animations, tinkering with the state machine, implementing mechanics, and adding behaviors to the behavior tree. It felt like an adventure, every day was a new learning experience.

                <br>
                <br>

                The process was filled with countless iterations, a lot of trial and error, and a meticulous attention to detail. But the real thrill was seeing our ideas take shape, creating gameplay that kept players on their toes. Although Deadwood Dominance is still in its alpha stage, the journey has been nothing short of amazing. The sense of accomplishment I feel, knowing that I’ve contributed to the game’s immersive gameplay, is something I hold closely.

                AI Health Indication
            </div>

            <p>
                In Deadwood Dominance, one of the features I take great pride in is the health indicators for our AI. The solution might seem straightforward now, but initially, we were at a crossroads. Some team members suggested floating health bars above the AI, while others proposed a static health bar for the last hit enemy at the top-center of the screen. Both options, however, fell short. Given the hordes of zombies (AI) in our game, neither approach would allow players to accurately gauge a zombie’s health.

                <br>
                <br>

                So, what did I do? I got creative. I exported the AI materials and re-colored them three times using Photoshop. As a result, the AI’s mesh changes color based on their health percentage, giving players a clear indication of how close each zombie is to defeat.

                <br>
                <br>

                What makes me proud isn’t the complexity of the solution, but rather its effectiveness in overcoming a challenge. That’s what game development is all about, isn’t it?

                AI Knockback
            </div>

            <p>
                In the development of Deadwood Dominance, one of the most significant mechanics I implemented was the AI knockback ability, also known as impulse. Given the game’s hoard-like zombie setting, it was crucial to equip the player with a defensive mechanism for those moments when they’re swarmed by enemies. It might seem straightforward on the surface, but the inner workings presented quite a challenge.

                <br>
                <br>

                Initially, I envisioned a ragdoll-like core for this mechanic. However, it quickly became clear that this approach was causing more problems than it was solving. So, it was back to the drawing board for me.

                <br>
                <br>

                The solution I came up with was the impulse mechanic. Here’s how it works: The impulse performs a multi-sphere trace, checking for the AI Base class. For each AI hit, it checks if it’s already in the array. If it isn’t, it gets added; if it is, it’s ignored. Then, each AI has their behavior aborted to initiate the knockback, which triggers the corresponding animation. To prevent the player from getting stuck in the knocked-back AI, the collision is turned off.

                <br>
                <br>

                After a duration that’s synced with the animation, the collision is turned back on. The animation then transitions to the standing pose and resumes playing. The behavior tree switches to attack/chase mode, and the array is cleared.

                Death States
            </div>

            <p>
                The AI characters have two distinct death states, each triggered based on the AI’s current state.

                <br>
                <br>

                The first is what we call the normal death state. This state is triggered when the AI character is not in a knocked-back state. In this scenario, the AI plays a standing death animation and then falls to the ground, simulating a typical death sequence.

                <br>
                <br>

                The second state is the ground death state. This state comes into play when the AI character has been knocked back. In this case, the AI plays a ground death animation, depicting a death scenario where the AI character is already on the ground.

                <br>
                <br>

                This dual-state death mechanic adds a layer of realism to the game, making the AI characters react differently to death based on their current state. It’s these little details that contribute to the immersive gameplay experience in Deadwood Dominance.
